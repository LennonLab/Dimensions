# Rarity and detection drive microbial taxa-area relationships 

## From Sept DoB meeting:
*Why do we have low z-values in microbial communities? Honer-Devine have some thoughts, which are now entrenched in the literature. Lennon and Jones (2011) posit it could be due to dormancy.* 

*However, Ken's results suggest this is a sampling issue. More N, more z. Could this be a small paper? Could this just be done with the pond data?*

## Fodder for the Introduction 
### Paragraph 1?
1. The species-area relationship (SAR) reveals the rate at which species (*S*) are discovered with increasing area (*A*) (Lomolino 2000).
2. The SAR among the most intensively studied ecological patterns and is historically described as a power-law where $S = CA^{z}$ (Arrhenius 1921, Harte 2011).
3. The analogous microbial taxa-area relationship (TAR), where $T = CA^{z}$, has also become an intensively studied relationship of microbial biogeography.
4. However, unlike the SARs of macroscopic plants and animals, where the scaling exponent $z$ usually takes a value between 0.2 and 0.5 (Lomolino 2000), the TAR of microbial communities is much shallower (Horner-Devine et al. 2004, Green et al. 2004).
5. The value of $z$ for microbes historically ranges between 0.0 and 0.2 (Horner-Devine et al. 2004, Green et al. 2004, Lennon and Jones 2011). 
6. However, most of the seminal contributions to the understanding of the TAR predate modern sequencing and may fail to capture an important consequence of rarity, i.e., the value of $z$ is driven by discovery of rare taxa.

###Paragraph 2?

1. The relationship between abundance and occurrence is well documented (Brown 1995, 1999).
2. That is, greater abundance within an environment generally leads to more frequent occurrence across the environment.
3. Likewise, it has been well-known for over a century that most species in an ecological community are rare (McGill et al. 2007). 
4. Within the last decade, it has come to light that this widespread pattern of commonness and rarity may be exceptional among microbes, where the vast majority of taxa are rare (Sogin et al. 2006).
5. In this way, if a microbial sampling scheme failed to detect the majority of rare organisms, it might also fail to detect the accumulation of taxa.
6. The expected result would, indeed, be a TAR with a shallow slope.

### Paragraph 3?
1. We suspect that the shallow form of the microbial TAR is largely due to the detection limits of older technology (see Woodcock et al. 2006).
2. There is some evidence for this in recent studies of the TAR, where $z$ takes values that are typical of those seen in the SAR of plants and animals (Zinger et al. 2012).
3. If this proves to be the case, then the history of the microbial TAR will need to be reconsidered.
4. Likewise, the characterization of microbial TARs will need to account for detection limits and/or rarity.
4. Fortunately, there are already methods in place for addressing these issues, e.g., richness estimation as opposed to using observed *S*, resampling methods, and simulation modeling (Gotelli 1999, 2001, Magurran and McGill 2013).
