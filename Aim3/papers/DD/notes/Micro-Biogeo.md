#Micro-Biogeo: Distance-Decay

### Finkel et al. 2012
**Title** Distance-Decay Relationships Partially Determine Diversity Patterns of Phyllosphere Bacteria on Tamrix Trees across the Sonoran Desert

**Methods** Measured dispersal limitation in phyllosphere communities on leaf surfaces of salt-excreting *Tamarix* trees. Used 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Meaured bacterial community dissimilarity on leaves of trees from sites with uniform climatic conditions across a 500km transet in the Sonoran Desert. *Note:* Used a probability-based Chao distance metric and locally-weighted polynomial regression.   

**Results** Saw significant distance-decay relationships but was entirely driven by betaproteo. Four dominant phyla showed different effects of environmental and geographic variables. Geographic distance was the most important parameter that affected community composition.

**Ken's comments:** Would have been stronger had they used a few distance metrics (unweighted, weighted). Don't know why they'd not use a simple linear regression; a common approach that yields a more interpretable value (slope).

**Title** Drivers shaping the diversity and biogeography of total and active bacterial communities in the South China Sea

**Methods**
Examined the bacterial community composition along two transects, one from the inner Pearl River estuary to the open waters of the South China Sea (SCS) and the other from the Luzon Strait to the SCS basin. Used 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene (V1-3 regions), characterizing the active and total bacterial community, respectively. Used weighted and unweighted Unifrac measures of (dis)similarity. Also used Mantel, Vegan, NMDS, AMOVA, MOTHUR, Chao1, Inverse Simpson, CCA for Env., Network analysis

**Results**
Diversity and biogeographic patterns differed between active and total bacterial communities. Composition of total and active was correlated with environmental factors and with geographic distance. The active bacterial community displayed higher environmental sensitivity than total. The 16S rRNA vs. rDNA relationships indicated that the active bacteria were low in relative abundance in the SCS. They speculate that high competition could cause some dispersal limitation of the active bacterial community resulting in a distinct distance-decay relationship. But their results indicate that geographic distribution of bacteria in the SCS results from environment and dispersal.

**Comments** Confidence in network analysis? Rarefaction indicates they missed many taxa.
