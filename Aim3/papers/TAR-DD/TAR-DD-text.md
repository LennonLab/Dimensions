## Fodder for the Introduction 
###Paragraph 2?

1. The relationship between abundance and occurrence is well documented (Brown 1995, 1999).
2. That is, greater abundance within an environment generally leads to more frequent occurrence across the environment.
3. Likewise, it has been well-known for over a century that most species in an ecological community are rare (McGill et al. 2007). 
4. Within the last decade, it has come to light that this widespread pattern of commonness and rarity may be exceptional among microbes, where the vast majority of taxa are rare (Sogin et al. 2006).
5. In this way, if a microbial sampling scheme failed to detect the majority of rare organisms, it might also fail to detect the accumulation of taxa.
6. The expected result would, indeed, be a TAR with a shallow slope.

### Paragraph 3?
1. We suspect that the shallow form of the microbial TAR is largely due to the detection limits of older technology (see Woodcock et al. 2006).
2. There is some evidence for this in recent studies of the TAR, where $z$ takes values that are typical of those seen in the SAR of plants and animals (Zinger et al. 2012).
3. If this proves to be the case, then the history of the microbial TAR will need to be reconsidered.
4. Likewise, the characterization of microbial TARs will need to account for detection limits and/or rarity.
4. Fortunately, there are already methods in place for addressing these issues, e.g., richness estimation as opposed to using observed *S*, resampling methods, and simulation modeling (Gotelli 1999, 2001, Magurran and McGill 2013).
